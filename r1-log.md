Worked with Js async built-in features like readfile , writefile , promises , callbacks , async/await. Got involved with bash scripting learned about how to use nano , create new files (specifically .sh / bash files ), played with it used variables (which allows only one value to be used multiple times instead of using that value multiple times manually) , how to get values from user using read , how to allow messages to be called after specific amount of time using space keyword.
